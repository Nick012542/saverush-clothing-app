            Use of the Save Rush Platform is permitted only to individuals who
            are competent to enter into a legally binding contract under the
            Indian Contract Act, 1872. Accordingly, persons who are "incompetent
            to contract" as defined under the Act, including minors under the
            age of 18 years, are not eligible to use or transact on the
            Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not knowingly solicit, collect, or store personal data from
            individuals under the age of 18. If it comes to our attention that
            any such data has been inadvertently collected, we will take
            appropriate steps to delete it. However, in cases where you have
            voluntarily provided personal data relating to a child under 18
            years of age, you affirm that you are legally authorized to do so
            either as the parent or legal guardian of the child, and you consent
            to our processing of that data in accordance with this Privacy
            Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strongly recommend that minors do not register on the Platform or
            make use of our services without the involvement and supervision of
            a parent or legal guardian.
