          <p>
            Users of the Save Rush Platform interact with one another
            independently for the purpose of conducting transactions. Save Rush,
            operated under the Kanaklata Group, does not participate in or
            exercise control over the actual transaction process between buyers
            and sellers. All commercial and contractual terms such as product
            pricing, delivery timelines, shipping costs, mode of payment,
            payment terms, product warranties, and post-sale services are
            determined solely between the buyer and the seller. Save Rush
            neither defines nor influences these terms in any capacity. The
            Platform does not make any warranties or representations regarding
            the quality, value, saleability, or overall performance of the
            products listed or sold through it. Responsibility for fulfilling
            the terms of any agreement lies entirely with the respective buyers
            and sellers. Save Rush holds no ownership, rights, or liabilities
            concerning the items transacted on the Platform. It is solely a
            medium through which users can discover products and connect with
            sellers. The contract for sale remains exclusively between the buyer
            and the seller, and Save Rush bears no responsibility for
            unsatisfactory or delayed services, or for issues arising from
            unavailability, backorders, or inventory-related delays. In
            situations where product prices or descriptions appear incorrectly
            due to technical glitches, typographical mistakes, or incorrect
            listings by sellers, Save Rush reserves the right to cancel such
            orders on behalf of the seller. Users agree to release and indemnify
            Save Rush and its representatives from any claims, costs, or
            consequences arising from the conduct of other users. Despite
            reasonable measures taken, Save Rush cannot guarantee the accuracy
            or reliability of content shared by users on the Platform and
            disclaims liability for such third-party information.

            User Conduct & Platform Rules
          </h2>
          <p>
            By accessing and using the Save Rush Platform, users are deemed to
            have agreed to abide by certain fundamental principles that govern
            appropriate behavior and lawful use of the services provided under
            the Kanaklata Group. Any breach of these principles may lead to
            suspension, termination, or other necessary action against the user
            account. Users are expected to refrain from engaging in any
            unlawful, fraudulent, or malicious behavior while using the
            Platform. Activities such as misusing another user’s contact
            details, placing orders with false or invalid information, overusing
            promotional vouchers not tagged to a verified email ID, or refusing
            to pay for confirmed orders fall under prohibited practices.
            Repeated return of incorrect items or frequent false compensation
            requests also constitute misuse. Any attempts to gain unauthorized
            access, exploit system loopholes, or solicit sensitive user data are
            considered serious violations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are discouraged from placing orders that reflect commercial
            intent or business-to-business transactions, especially bulk orders
            placed using technological glitches, fake addresses, or with the aim
            of resale. Misusing promotional offers, engaging in behavior that
            causes financial or operational harm to the Platform, or attempting
            to avail benefits like input tax credit through unauthorized
            transactions will not be tolerated. Furthermore, the use of
            impersonation tactics, multiple identities, false addresses, or any
            form of disruption to the services or experience of other users is
            considered against the Platform's values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Content shared by users must not violate any applicable laws or
            infringe on the rights of others. Users are expected to avoid
            uploading or disseminating material that is defamatory, obscene,
            harassing, invasive of privacy, or otherwise illegal in nature.
            Content that promotes spam, misleading information, or infringes
            upon intellectual property rights is strictly prohibited. Use of
            bots, scraping tools, or unauthorized programs to interact with or
            extract data from the Platform is not permitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a violation, Save Rush retains the right to cancel
            orders classified as fraudulent or excessive at any point during the
            transaction. Users found participating in such behavior may have
            their accounts terminated without prior notice. Any credits, loyalty
            rewards, or goodwill compensations associated with such accounts may
            be permanently revoked. Save Rush does not guarantee exactness in
            terms of product dimensions, color, or appearance as seen on the
            Platform; users are encouraged to consult the Return & Exchange
            Policy for any related concerns. Should a user’s actions breach
            these terms, Save Rush reserves the right to unilaterally terminate
            access and revoke all associated account benefits. Continued use of
            the Platform constitutes acceptance of these guidelines, and users
            are advised to review the full Terms of Use and Privacy Policy for
            further clarity.

            Disclaimer of Warranties & Service Availability

            All materials, products, and services, whether software-related or
            otherwise, made accessible to users through the Save Rush Platform
            are offered strictly on an “as is” and “as available” basis, unless
            otherwise stated in writing. There is no express or implied warranty
            associated with the Platform or its contents, and no guarantee is
            made regarding uninterrupted availability or the completeness,
            accuracy, or reliability of the information provided. While every
            effort is taken to ensure smooth operations, Save Rush, operating
            under the Kanaklata Group, does not guarantee that the Platform will
            remain consistently available or error-free at all times, nor that
            the content displayed will always be up-to-date or entirely free
            from inaccuracies.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that products listed and sold on the
            Platform are subject to various regulations as per state-specific
            laws. If, due to such legal constraints, a seller is unable to
            deliver a purchased item to the buyer, the seller will either
            initiate a refund or offer credit for any advance payment that may
            have been received. In order to process orders effectively, users
            are required to provide a valid mobile number during checkout. By
            registering a phone number on the Platform, users give consent to be
            contacted via phone calls or SMS for essential updates related to
            order confirmations, shipping, or delivery statuses. It is also
            clarified that Save Rush will not use personal contact information
            to initiate unsolicited promotional calls or marketing messages.

            Payment Terms, Limitations, and Refund Policy
          </h2>
          <p>
            While availing any of the payment methods offered on the Save Rush
            Platform, users acknowledge that Kanaklata Group and its associated
            platform Save Rush will not be held liable for any direct or
            indirect loss or damage resulting from issues such as lack of
            authorization, breaches of transaction limits set by the user's
            bank, failed transactions, or any form of transaction denial due to
            unforeseen reasons. All payments for purchases made on the Platform
            are to be strictly processed in Indian Rupees, and transactions
            involving foreign currency are not supported. To ensure the safety
            of online transactions, users may be required to provide valid
            identification and address verification documents before dispatch,
            especially when discrepancies or high-value orders are flagged.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is clearly understood that all transactions executed via the
            Platform are part of a direct, principal-to-principal agreement
            between the buyer and the seller. The Platform acts only as a
            facilitator, enabling the use of various payment gateways and
            collection mechanisms, including options such as online banking and
            Cash on Delivery. Save Rush does not function as a financial
            institution or fiduciary and holds no responsibility for issues
            related to product delivery, damages, breach of warranty, or service
            failures arising from such transactions. When a user initiates a
            payment through the Platform, they are entering into a binding
            contract with the seller, and it is their responsibility to fulfill
            the agreed-upon transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Buyers and sellers may mutually agree via platform-supported tools
            to modify delivery schedules or transaction details within the terms
            permitted by Save Rush’s policies. In situations where delivery
            fails to occur within the promised timeframe, buyers may claim a
            refund as per the policies, provided the request is raised within
            the stipulated period through the appropriate platform features.
            Refunds may not be processed for certain categories where exclusions
            are stated in the Platform’s refund policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Refunds, when applicable, will be processed through the same issuing
            bank or payment method originally used by the buyer, except in the
            case of Cash on Delivery, where electronic transfer will be used.
            All refunds will be issued strictly in Indian Rupees, and through
            authorized methods such as NEFT, RTGS, or other RBI-approved banking
            systems. In cases where a particular bank is not supported, users
            will be required to provide alternative bank account details for
            remittance. Refund processing may also be subject to verification
            steps or document requests to ensure buyer authenticity and prevent
            misuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kanaklata Group reserves the right to impose transaction limits
            based on value or volume, whether per user, per payment instrument,
            or as governed by the payment aggregator or RBI guidelines.
            Transactions may also be declined at the discretion of the Platform
            if associated with prior disputes, policy violations, or high-risk
            activities. Before confirming receipt of payment (especially in Cash
            on Delivery scenarios), Save Rush may perform background checks to
            validate the credibility of both the buyer and the transaction.
            Based on the results, the Platform may reserve the right to deny the
            transaction altogether. In cases involving suspicious activity,
            high-risk orders, or legal concerns, Save Rush may delay or withhold
            transaction confirmation and may, in cooperation with law
            enforcement, withhold funds instead of processing a refund.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, all digital transactions whether by card, wallet, UPI,
            or online bank transfer are subject to the individual terms and
            conditions established between the user and their respective issuing
            banks or payment partners. Save Rush does not intervene in disputes
            between users and financial institutions, and all such transactions
            are governed by external banking terms applicable at the time of
            payment processing.
